This is project is created to create a use NLP and ELMo to extract information from a context.
NLP - natural language processing
ELMo - embedding for language models.

In this project, we are specifically focusing on creating a language model for extract and detect only negative customer riview for a company  on their twitter reviews. 

After completing the project we can understand that, ELMos are very effective ML algorithms. 
So, what we can create by modifying these simple Models:
we can create Natural language processing tasks:

1. Machine Translation
2. Language Modeling
3. Text Summarization
4. Named Entity Recognition
5. Question-Answering Systems
